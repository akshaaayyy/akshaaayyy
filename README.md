### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Aspiring Data Scientist graduated with a Masters degree in Machine Learning, I have gained a strong understanding in Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Big Data Technologies, Data Management, and Statistical Machine Learning, and I have had the opportunity to apply these skills through various projects and an internship. I designed and developed a dashboard on software bugs during my summer internship where Gigabytes of real-time data were condensed and visualized in the most intuitive dashboard for the head of the Quality and Assurance team. Additionally, I have developed strong problem-solving analytical skills, leadership skills, and presentation skills, as I have taken part in and led teams in multiple national-level Hackathons. I have also two research projects, and got a research paper published in the reputed IEEE Journal.
